NAME
    RT::Extension::SideBySideView - SideBySide Ticket View for RT

SYNOPSIS
    Based on an original Idea from Steve Turner (MIT) and Markus Dirr
    (GreenCircle) and the ground work of Thomas Sibley (BestPractical) and
    some Ideas from BPS Wiki this AddOn will give you the option to change
    the Ticket View from original BPS View to a so called SideBySide Ticket
    View (known from wiki).

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.0 and 4.2
    
    New Version for RT 4.2. Files for RT 4.0 and older are still in place 
    with .40 extension.

INSTALLATION
            1. Run "perl Makefile.PL"

            2. Run "make"

            3. Run "make install" (you may need root permissions)

            4. Additionally, if you're running 3.8 or 4.0, you'll need to add
            "RT::Extension::SideBySideView" to @Plugins in
            etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm.  For example:
            Set( @Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::SideBySideView) );
            
            5. If your are running 4.2, you'll need to add to Plugins like this:
            Plugin('RT::Extension::SideBySideView');

            6. Clear RT's mason cache and restart the web server to make sure the
            extension is incorporated.

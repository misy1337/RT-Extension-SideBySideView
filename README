NAME
  RT::Extension::SideBySideView

DESCRIPTION
  Based on an original Idea from Steve Turner (MIT) and Markus Dirr (GreenCircle) 
  and the ground work of Thomas Sibley (BestPractical) and some Ideas from BPS 
  Wiki this AddOn will give you the option to change the Ticket View from original
  BPS View to a so called SideBySide Ticket View (known from wiki).


INSTALLATION
  1. Run "perl Makefile.PL"

  2. Run "make"

  3. Run "make install" (you may need root permissions)

  4. Additionally, if you're running 3.8, you'll need to add
     "RT::Extension::SideBySideView::CustomView" to @Plugins in
     etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm.  For example:
     Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::SideBySideView::CustomView RT::FM));

  6. Clear RT's mason cache and restart the web server to make sure the
     extension is incorporated.

  Under the same terms as perl itself.
